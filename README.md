<pre>
SQLBuilder is one demo of showing how to make SQL clauses by C#.

Some ideas are from JTA, but approach of all features is beyond my ability.

Notice:
Itâ€™s a demo, in other words, I made it for studying language-relate features of C#.
The test and only test written in Program.cs is completely.
The demo classes are written under Demo folder.
